# Object oriented Programming Using C++

This C++ code represents a Game Management System that allows users to create and manage tournaments for different types of games (Chess, Cricket, Wrestling, Badminton, Table Tennis, Basketball, Soccer). The code defines classes for games, teams, and players, and implements inheritance and polymorphism to handle specific game rules for each sport. Users can input the number of teams, players, and rounds for the tournament, and the system generates and plays matches between teams, declaring the winners based on user-input scores. The code also incorporates error handling for invalid inputs or team configurations.
